    <p> I like tigers because the tiger is the biggest species of the cat family.

            Tigers can reach a length of up to 3.3 metres (11 feet) and weigh as much as 300 kilograms (660 pounds).
            
            Subspecies of the tiger include the Sumatran Tiger, Siberian Tiger, Bengal Tiger, South China Tiger, Malayan Tiger and Indochinese Tiger.
            
            Many subspecies of the tiger are either endangered or already extinct. Humans are the primary cause of this through hunting and the destruction of habitats.
            
            Around half of tiger cubs don’t live beyond two years of age.
            
            Tiger cubs leave their mother when they are around 2 years of age.
            
            A group of tigers is known as an ‘ambush’ or ‘streak’.
            
            Tigers are good swimmers and can swim up to 6 kilometres.</p>
